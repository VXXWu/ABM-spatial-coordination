# Model Purpose
To explore how subsidies interact with varied farm size and farm size heterogeneity to influence farmersâ€™ decisions about sharing natural enemy service to reduce pesticide use in a spatially explicit environment. The model is informed by strategic and behavioral patterns in the NonCropShare game data and theories of bounded rationality and case-based reasoning.

# Model Design
The model represents an abstracted farming environment that exists at three geometric scales: patch (individual piece of land), farm (area of adjacent patches controlled by one farmer), and landscape (the entire collection of farms). Farmers are motivated by income and record in memory states the income generated at different geometric scales in previous agricultural seasons. This drives decision processes around farm-level strategy and patch-level land use. Farmers under the non-HS strategy do not use HS patches while farmers under the HS strategy use all four patch-level land-use choices. For each patch they own, farmers select the land use choice with the highest objective measure, calculated based on behavioral preferences and the income per patch generated at each geometric scale. Based on initialized trust values with neighbors, farmers decide whether to coordinate with a social cluster in adopting a collective group farm-level strategy. Farmers who decide not to coordinate simply choose the strategy with the highest average income in their memory.
